# Champion Compass

## **Project Overview**

**Champion Compass** is an innovative web application designed to guide new players of **League of Legends (LoL)** in discovering champions that match their unique playstyle. The app introduces the core mechanics of the game, making it easier for beginners to navigate the complex world of **League of Legends**, a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. 

At its core, **Champion Compass** features an **interactive quiz** where users answer questions related to their preferences, strengths, and gaming style. Based on their responses, the app generates a personalized list of **five champion recommendations** that best align with their playstyle, ensuring that the player can start their LoL journey with champions that suit their strengths.

In addition to the quiz, the app provides educational content, including explanations of the game’s objectives, a breakdown of game mechanics, and an introduction to various champion roles, making it a valuable tool for newcomers to LoL.

## **Key Features**

**Interactive Quiz**:
   - The quiz asks players about their preferred playstyle (e.g., aggressive, defensive, supportive), preferred roles (e.g., top lane, mid lane, jungle), and how they approach strategy.
   - Based on the user's responses, the app recommends champions that match their style, offering a tailored experience for each player.
   
**Champion Recommendations**:
   - Once the quiz is completed, the app suggests five champions from the **League of Legends** roster. Recommendations are personalized based on gameplay style, role preference, and difficulty level.
   
**Game Introduction**:
   - The app educates new players on the objectives and core mechanics of LoL, such as farming, objectives (e.g., dragons, baron), team fights, and positioning.
   
**Detailed Champion Information**:
   - Each recommended champion is accompanied by a profile that includes basic stats, abilities, playstyle tips, and strategy guides.
   
**ChatGPT API Integration**:
   - **ChatGPT** is integrated to assist players with personalized guidance, champion tips, and additional explanations about LoL mechanics. Players can ask questions about gameplay and receive real-time answers.
   
**Riot Data Dragon API**:
   - Champion data, including statistics, abilities, and item recommendations, is fetched using the **Riot Data Dragon API**, ensuring the app always provides up-to-date and accurate information.

**User Authentication**:
   - Users can now create accounts, log in, and save their quiz results. This feature allows players to track their champion recommendations over time and customize their preferences.
   - The authentication system enhances user engagement and provides a personalized experience that retains user data for future sessions.

## **Technologies Used**

**Angular**:
   - The front-end of the app is built using **Angular**, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface. Angular's robust framework provides the scalability and maintainability necessary for complex web applications.
   
**MongoDB**:

**ChatGPT API**:
   - The **ChatGPT API** is integrated to provide real-time responses to player questions, offering an AI-powered interactive experience. This allows users to interact with the app in a more conversational way, asking for help with champions or game mechanics.
   
**Riot Data Dragon API**:
   - The **Riot Data Dragon API** is used to fetch up-to-date data on champions, items, and other LoL game information. This ensures that the app delivers accurate and current champion profiles and game details.

## **Lessons Learned**

**Integration with External APIs**:
   - Integrating the **Riot Data Dragon API** presented some challenges, particularly around rate limiting and data management. Ensuring the data was accurate and properly formatted required careful handling of API requests and responses.
   
**User-Centric Design**:
   - Designing an intuitive user interface that appeals to beginners was a key lesson. We found that offering clear instructions, easy navigation, and simplified explanations of complex game mechanics was essential for engaging new players.

**Personalization and Recommendation Systems**:
   - Building the recommendation algorithm to match champions with a player’s style was a complex but rewarding task. Incorporating player preferences through the quiz helped refine the champion suggestions, ensuring a better user experience.

**Real-Time Data Access**:
   - Ensuring the **ChatGPT API** provided quick and relevant responses to player queries was important. Optimizing the app to handle dynamic interactions while maintaining performance was a key technical challenge.
